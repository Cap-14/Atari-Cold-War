## Some developer FAQ

### Why is there no build in the builds folder?

It's empty on purpose. It's only supposed to contain local builds, that's why builds don't get commited by the .gitignore.

### How do i build it?

buildit.bat, for Linux good luck, vekidev here i couldn't build it on Arch sooooo.... if you figure it out, check out the Pull Requests tab (wink)
